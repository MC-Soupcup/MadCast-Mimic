## 1.0.2 current (3/27/2015)
Additions:
 - Solar Expansion, read bottom of post.
 - An optional mod: Journeymap. Disabled by default, you can enable it and disable voxelmap if you like.
 
Removals:
 - Solar Flux, read bottom of post.
 - Pam's Simple Recipes
   - All this did was add a few recipes to the game, it was pointless to have as I've re-added the recipes with Minetweaker.

Fixes and Changes:
 - Forge version updated from 1291 to 1341.
 - Vanilla Stained Glass can now be re-colored, any combination Stained Glass can surround a dye to become that color.
 - Stained Clay can now be re-colored, same as above.
 - IC2 Refined Iron Ingot removed from the ingotSteel ore dictionary, because I could not remove its recipes from the Induction Smelter. Imbalances other steel recipes too much.
 - Fixed an issue where Chisel's recipes would conflict with Botany Trowels, both now have static recipes (Chisel is a stick in the lower-left, ingot/diamond in the upper-right, Trowels are the opposite facing)
 - Fixed an issue where there was a bug between Forge and FastCraft and structure generation (Translation: Ted can no longer crash us. :P)
 - Re-added most recipes from Pam's Simple Recipes since it was removed.
 - BuildCraft Quarry has been disabled, use the Ender Quarry.
 - BuildCraft Mining Well has had its recipe nerfed.
 - Various circuits have been oredictionaried together in two types: circuitTierOne and circuitTierTwo. These circuits can be interchanged in most recipes.
 - Hardened Glass variants from other mods have been ore dictionaried together, and can be interchanged in most recipes.
 - Big Reactors' recipes have changed again. All blocks for Reactors and Turbines have had their recipes changed.
     - Note: Previously, the only two nerfed recipes were the controllers. Those have been reverted and I decided to change all recipes. It's overall more expensive, but each part is much cheaper than the controllers were.
 - Big Reactors have had their fuel usage increased and Turbines have their power output increased. This is to make Turbines actually better than just a huge Reactor.
     - Note: Think about it like this, one decent sized reactor could power a number of Turbines that output more power than a huge reactor that uses a ton more fuel. It's more expensive to make all those turbines, but you'll get more power out of it.
 - Ender Quarry's recipe got a slight nerf. Requires one more Ender Core.
 - Disabled crafting of Ilemnite Reed from BobGary's Growable Ores. This previously made Titanium. Having this is like having a plant make Enderium ingots.
 - The Digital Miner, Robit, and Atomic Assembler's recipes have changed again.
     - Note: Similar in difficulty. I had to change them because the new Mekanism version broke the machine support from ModTweaker, so it's all done via already available machine recipes and crafting table recipes.
 - Mekanism's Solar Panel (crafting component), Solar Generator, Advanced Solar Generator, and Wind Turbine have had their recipes changed.
 - ComputerCraft's items have had their recipes changed. This better helps balance them against their massive capabilities.
 - Biomes O' Plenty and Natura trees are now compatible with the MFR Harvester and Planter!
 - Botania flowers now have Thaumcraft aspects when scanned!
 - Fixed the vanilla rail recipe to only use Railcraft's recipe.
 - Added a tooltip to Rutile Ore so people know where to get it... >.>
 - Many bugfixes from mods being updated.
 - Armor Status HUD is now on the left side of the screen so it doesn't overlap the hotbar. For real this time.
 - Slightly adjusted ore generation (Note: only affects new chunks):
    - Silver has had its spawn rate reduced by roughly 40% (my bad for it being so high).
       - Since Silver spawns with Lead, Lead has been reduced by roughly 20% as a result.
    - Adamantine and Atlarus have been reduced to be slightly less common than diamond. These two combine to make Tartarite, the most powerful metal for tools.
    - Redstone has been very slightly increased.
    - Platinum (Shiny Ore) has been reduced by roughly a third. A typo on my end made it spawn more than intended. It's now slightly more common than diamond.
    - Peridot, Ruby, and Sapphire have been reduced by roughly a third. Was spawning a lot more than intended.
 
Known Issues:
 - There is a rare error when the game tries to spawn (?) a mob with a bad ID (?). (S0FPacketSpawnMob error)
