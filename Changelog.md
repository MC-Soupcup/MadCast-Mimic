## 1.0.3 (4/24/2015)
Additions:
 - Magical Bees 2.2.2
    - Adds more bees that do things with Thaumcraft, Ars Magica 2, and more.
 - Steve's Addons 0.10.5
    - Fixes a few Steve's Factory Manager bugs and adds the ability to copy/paste Manager programs (best thing ever pretty much)

Removals:
 - MFFS
 - Resonant Induction
 - Resonant Engine
    - The reason for these to be removed is because they are massively outdated, and haven't been updated in a long time. We will revisit these if they ever update again.

Fixes:
 - Due to the removal of the three mods listed above, there shouldn't be anymore weirdness with AE2 terminals not showing items (let me know if it happens again!)
 - The Thermal Expansion Induction Smelter singleplayer crash seems to have been fixed, I can no longer reproduce it with the new updates. This was likely because Modtweaker updated to fix some issues with TE.
 - Thanks to a Modtweaker update, steel dust now gives Mekanism steel ingots in Thermal Expansion's Furnace and Induction Smelter, instead of giving Refined Iron.
 - Multi Page Chest now takes an additional Diamond Chest, since it has 5 pages (which are bigger than diamond chests' pages).
 - Fixed a weird thing where ingots of many kinds (e.g. copper ingots) were converting into Thaumcraft Iron Nuggets instead of the proper nuggets.
 - Fixed an Advanced Genetics and Random Things conflict with a heal crystal block.
 - Now only one Mekanism Portable Tank will be in NEI (these caused some render issues)
 - Modpack now with 80% less version update spam (hopefully, MCA stuff is still there)!
 - Disabled the crafting of Uranium and Yellorium growable reeds, I forgot to do so last update when the Magical Crops ones were disabled.

Notes:

## 1.0.2 (3/29/2015)
Additions:
 - Solar Expansion, read bottom of post.
 - An optional mod: Journeymap. Disabled by default, you can enable it and disable voxelmap if you like.
 
Removals:
 - Solar Flux, read bottom of post.
 - Flan's Mod is disabled by default for now, until I get more info/figure out the spawn mob error.
 - Pam's Simple Recipes
   - All this did was add a few recipes to the game, it was pointless to have as I've re-added the recipes with Minetweaker.

Fixes and Changes:
 - Forge version updated from 1291 to 1343.
 - Vanilla Stained Glass can now be re-colored, any combination Stained Glass can surround a dye to become that color.
 - Stained Clay can now be re-colored, same as above.
 - IC2 Refined Iron Ingot removed from the ingotSteel ore dictionary, because I could not remove its recipes from the Induction Smelter. Imbalances other steel recipes too much.
 - Fixed an issue where Chisel's recipes would conflict with Botany Trowels, both now have static recipes (Chisel is a stick in the lower-left, ingot/diamond in the upper-right, Trowels are the opposite facing)
 - Fixed an issue where there was a bug between Forge and FastCraft and structure generation (Translation: Ted can no longer crash us. :P)
 - Re-added most recipes from Pam's Simple Recipes since it was removed.
 - BuildCraft Quarry has been disabled, use the Ender Quarry.
 - BuildCraft Mining Well has had its recipe nerfed.
 - Various circuits have been oredictionaried together in two types: circuitTierOne and circuitTierTwo. These circuits can be interchanged in most recipes.
 - Hardened Glass variants from other mods have been ore dictionaried together, and can be interchanged in most recipes.
 - Big Reactors' recipes have changed again. All blocks for Reactors and Turbines have had their recipes changed.
     - Note: Previously, the only two nerfed recipes were the controllers. Those have been reverted and I decided to change all recipes. It's overall more expensive, but each part is much cheaper than the controllers were.
 - Big Reactors have had their fuel usage increased and Turbines have their power output increased. This is to make Turbines actually better than just a huge Reactor.
     - Note: Think about it like this, one decent sized reactor could power a number of Turbines that output more power than a huge reactor that uses a ton more fuel. It's more expensive to make all those turbines, but you'll get more power out of it.
 - Ender Quarry's recipe got a slight nerf. Requires one more Ender Core.
 - Disabled crafting of Ilemnite Reed from BobGary's Growable Ores. This previously made Titanium. Having this is like having a plant make Enderium ingots.
 - The Digital Miner, Robit, and Atomic Assembler's recipes have changed again.
     - Note: Similar in difficulty. I had to change them because the new Mekanism version broke the machine support from ModTweaker, so it's all done via already available machine recipes and crafting table recipes.
 - Mekanism's Solar Panel (crafting component), Solar Generator, Advanced Solar Generator, and Wind Turbine have had their recipes changed.
 - ComputerCraft's items have had their recipes changed. This better helps balance them against their massive capabilities.
 - Biomes O' Plenty and Natura trees are now compatible with the MFR Harvester and Planter!
 - Botania flowers now have Thaumcraft aspects when scanned!
 - Fixed the vanilla rail recipe to only use Railcraft's recipe.
 - Added a tooltip to Rutile Ore so people know where to get it... >.>
 - Many bugfixes from mods being updated.
 - Armor Status HUD is now on the left side of the screen so it doesn't overlap the hotbar. For real this time.
 - Slightly adjusted ore generation (Note: only affects new chunks):
    - Silver has had its spawn rate reduced by roughly 40% (my bad for it being so high).
       - Since Silver spawns with Lead, Lead has been reduced by roughly 20% as a result.
    - Adamantine and Atlarus have been reduced to be slightly less common than diamond. These two combine to make Tartarite, the most powerful metal for tools.
    - Redstone has been very slightly increased.
    - Platinum (Shiny Ore) has been reduced by roughly a third. A typo on my end made it spawn more than intended. It's now slightly more common than diamond.
    - Peridot, Ruby, and Sapphire have been reduced by roughly a third. Was spawning a lot more than intended.

On Minecraft Comes Alive:

MCA had a huge update, they completely rewrote the mod. Unfortunately, we cannot use it, because
they've changed too much. They even have a disclaimer on their site saying that it is not
compatible with old worlds. I tested it out and while at first it seemed fine, there were
tracking errors all over the console and an occasional crash when interacting with villagers.
Note that this is on a map with the old MCA, then I updated it, and went into that same world.
New worlds work perfectly with the mod, but we're not doing that again, so we're not using it.
 
Known Issues:
 - There is a rare error when the game tries to spawn (?) a mob with a bad ID (?). (S0FPacketSpawnMob error)
